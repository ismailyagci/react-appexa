# Services Module (`/src/services/index.js`)

This file appears to be a placeholder for potential future service abstractions.

## Current Status

As of the provided codebase context, this file is empty.

## Purpose (Potential)

In many application architectures, a `services` layer is introduced to encapsulate specific business logic or interactions with external systems that are not directly tied to UI state (managed by the store) or raw API requests (handled by the `request` module).

Examples could include:

-   Complex data transformations.
-   Orchestrating multiple API calls.
-   Interacting with browser APIs (like localStorage, though some of that is seen in the Auth example).

If this module were developed, services defined here might be imported and used within store module actions (thunks) to keep the actions themselves focused on dispatching state updates and coordinating simpler tasks.
