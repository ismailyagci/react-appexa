# Build Configuration (`/vite.config.js`)

This file configures Vite, the build tool used for developing and bundling the `react-appexa` library.

## Key Configuration Sections

1.  **`plugins: [react()]`**
    -   Uses the `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin, which enables React-specific features like Fast Refresh (HMR) during development and JSX transformation.

2.  **`build` Options**
    -   Configures the production build process (`vite build`).
    -   **`lib`**: Specifies that Vite should build a library.
        -   `entry`: `path.resolve("src", "index.js")` - Sets the main entry point of the library to `/src/index.js`.
        -   `name`: `"react-appexa"` - The global variable name when the library is used via a `<script>` tag in UMD format.
        -   `fileName`: `(format) => eact-appexa.${format}.js
` - Defines the output filenames based on the module format (e.g., `react-appexa.es.js`, `react-appexa.umd.js`).
    -   **`rollupOptions`**: Customizes the underlying Rollup bundler options.
        -   `external`: `["react", "react-dom"]` - Declares `react` and `react-dom` as external dependencies. This means they won't be bundled *into* the library; the consuming application is expected to provide them.
        -   `output`: `{ globals: { react: "React" } }` - Specifies the global variable names for external dependencies when using the UMD format (e.g., ensures `import React from 'react'` maps to the global `React` variable).

3.  **`esbuild` Options**
    -   `loader: "jsx"`: Tells esbuild (used internally by Vite for speed) to treat `.js` files as `.jsx`.
    -   `include: /src\/.*\.jsx?$/`: Ensures this loader applies to `.js` and `.jsx` files within the `src` directory.
    -   `exclude: []`: No files are explicitly excluded from this loader.

4.  **`optimizeDeps` Options**
    -   `esbuildOptions`: Configures esbuild specifically for dependency pre-bundling during development.
        -   `plugins`: Includes a custom esbuild plugin (`load-js-files-as-jsx`).
            -   **Purpose**: This plugin seems specifically designed to handle `.js` files within the `src` directory as if they were `.jsx` during the dependency optimization phase. It reads `.js` files and explicitly tells esbuild to process them with the `jsx` loader. This might be necessary if the project uses JSX syntax within `.js` files in the source, ensuring Vite's dev server handles them correctly.

## Summary

This configuration sets up Vite to:

-   Develop the library using React features.
-   Build the library into standard ES Module (`es.js`) and UMD (`umd.js`) formats.
-   Exclude React/ReactDOM from the bundle, treating them as peer dependencies.
-   Handle JSX syntax correctly, even if present in `.js` files within the source code, both during development and build.
