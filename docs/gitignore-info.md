# Git Ignore (`/.gitignore`)

This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. These are typically build artifacts, dependencies, or local configuration files that shouldn't be committed to the repository.

## Ignored Patterns

-   **`dist`**
    -   The directory containing the compiled output of the library generated by the `vite build` command. This is ignored because build artifacts should generally not be version-controlled; they are generated from the source code.
-   **`node_modules`**
    -   The directory where npm/yarn installs project dependencies. This is ignored because dependencies can be re-installed using the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files, and including them would bloat the repository.
-   **`yarn.lock`**
    -   The lock file generated by Yarn to ensure consistent dependency installations. While often committed in applications, it might be ignored in some library contexts if `package-lock.json` is preferred or if the library aims to be less strict about exact sub-dependency versions for consumers (though committing a lock file is generally recommended for reproducibility).
-   **`package-lock.json`**
    -   The lock file generated by npm (v5+) to ensure consistent dependency installations. Similar to `yarn.lock`, it's crucial for reproducible builds and is usually committed.
